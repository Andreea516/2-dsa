A queue is basically a simple linked list, that has it's elements added at the last of the list.
Each element is taken in order,by the rule "first in first out".
Operations : initialize list, add last (the elements are added to the last), maybe delete first (when the operation with
the first element is done, and we don't need it anymore), print from first to last
Limitations: we can't perform operations with the elements in the opposite order (from last to first), each element
is accessed in only from first to last
A stack is also a list, it's elements are added at the last of the list, but are accessed from last to first by the rule
"first in last out"
A stack can be a double linked list
Operations: initialize list, add last, print from last to first, delete last
Limitations: maybe we can't access the data from the first elements that easy, in order to reach the first element we need
to search the whole list
